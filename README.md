# HeightMapGeneration
HeightMapGeneration generates high resolution height maps. The height maps are 16-bit greyscale images. This is based on Martin O'Leary's [post](http://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/) about fantasy map generation.

## Libraries used
* [PNGJ](https://github.com/leonbloy/pngj) to create the .png images.
